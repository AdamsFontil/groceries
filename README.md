<h2>Publix Clone</h2>
<h4>Overview</h4>
I'm building this project to test what I've learned from FullStack Open. I also want to test my CSS and design skills. I plan to use Tailwind CSS extensively in this project to create a clone that's very similar to the Publix website. Although I don't like the color green, I will be using the same color scheme as the Publix website to replicate it and test my CSS skills.

<h4>Goals</h4>
This is a full-stack project, meaning that I will create a backend using REST to access the store catalog, users, and any other necessary components. I also want to implement user authentication and token authentication to test them out. Additionally, I plan to use MongoDB to store users, the store catalog, and pictures of all goods. I want to make sure the search bar works, and although deploying the site isn't necessary, I plan to try it out to test my deployment skills. Finally, I will validate the form that creates new users, with a focus on client-side validation.

<h4>Testing</h4>
I won't be doing unit testing, but I'll try to use Cypress for end-to-end testing. I like using Cypress more than Jest.
