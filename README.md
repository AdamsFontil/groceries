<h1>Publix Clone</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I'm building this project to test what I've learned from FullStack Open. I also want to test my CSS and design skills. I plan to use Tailwind CSS extensively in this project to create a clone that's very similar to the Publix website. Although I don't like the color green, I will be using the same color scheme as the Publix website to replicate it and test my CSS skills.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>This is a full-stack project, meaning that I will create a backend using REST to access the store catalog, users, and any other necessary components. I also want to implement user authentication and token authentication to test them out. Additionally, I plan to use MongoDB to store users, the store catalog, and pictures of all goods. I want to make sure the search bar works, and although deploying the site isn't necessary, I plan to try it out to test my deployment skills. Finally, I will validate the form that creates new users, with a focus on client-side validation.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>I plan on doing some unit testing Jest just to practice with technology, whilst also make sure certain components don't break. I'll also try to use Cypress for end-to-end testing, to ensure that the site functions and that major features are work over and over again.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li>React</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Express</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Page is almost fully responsive on mobile</li>
  <li>Page has a login page that doesn't really connect to any backend it just takes the username input and says that they've signed in</li>
  <li>Has a search bar that filters through all the items in the store</li>
  <li>Has dropdown menu</li>
  <li>Has dropdown menu</li>
  <li>Has slider</li>
  <li>Site is deployed and is updated everytime with every major push to github</li>


</ul>


<h3>Please Note</h3>
<p>This is an ongoing project the front-end is somewhat where I want it to be as the page is responsive and it my page is quite similar to the site that I'm replicating. But the backend is still really still a work in progress. I'll update this section with each major breakthrough and update the features sections to reflect the current state of this project.</p>
