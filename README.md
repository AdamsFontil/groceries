<h2>Publix Clone<h2>

<h3>Overview<h3>
I'm building this project, to test what I've learned from FullStack Open. I'd like to see also test my CSS, and designs here too. I'm going to make use tailwind extensively in this project to build a clone that's very similar to the Publix website. I don't really like the color green, amd thus I probably wouldn't use that color scheme much in my own project. But the Publix website is so good looking that I'd really like to try to replicate to see if my CSS skills are up to par, and test how great tailwind is. So far, tailwind is proving to be really amazing so the more I use it the better I'll get.

<h3>Goals<h3>
This project is meant to be a fullstack project meaning that after I've done making the page look good. I do intend on making a backend using REST to access the store catalog, users and whatever else may come up. I also would like to use user authentication to page and test token authententication. I'd also like to use MongoDB in this project to permanently store users, my store catalog along with the picture for all of the goods. Another thing that I want to make sure that the search bar works. Deploying the site isn't neccesary but I think that I'll try it out to make sure that I'm able to deploy projects as well. Validation is the last key thing that I'd like to do especially when it comes to the form that creates new users. I feel like client-side validation is much more important than validating on the server but this project is about practice so this is what I'll do.

The only thing I won't be doing, at least I think is unit testing, but I'll try to use Cypress and do E2E testing since using Cypress is much better than Jest imo.
